<div class="textblock"><p>DagBox uses a distributed design. Every component of the system is independant from the other components. This makes it possible to run every component concurrently, and it gives us several options on how to run the system. Each component can be run on separate threads in a single process, or separate processes in a single machine, or even in multiple machines distributed accross a network.</p>
<p>The components of DagBox communicate using message passing. We have chosen <a href="http://zeromq.org/">ZeroMQ</a> (Ã˜MQ) for messaging as it supports a variety of transports such as IPC and TCP, and when used in-process it has very minimal overhead. These properties allow DagBox to effectively perform when used as a small embedded database, while still allowing it to scale up when necessary.</p>

<div class="caption">
An overview of the architecture of DagBox.</div></div>
<p> At the core of DagBox, a message broker is responsible for routing the communications within the system. This message broker acts as a central point for all other components and the clients to connect to. Everything only directly communicates with the broker, the broker is responsible for routing those messages to their intended targets.</p>
<p>DagBox uses a service-oriented approach. The components of the system, workers, register the services they are able to provide to the broker and clients request specific services. The broker matches the requests with workers. Here, the broker performs load distribution: the requests are queued by the broker and distributed to the workers as they become free to do more work.</p>
<p>Requests sent to the workers are serialized with <a href="http://msgpack.org/">MessagePack</a>. MessagePack is a very efficient binary serialization format, with support for many programming languages.</p>
<p>The flexible design of DagBox makes it possible to write workers that perform many kinds of tasks. In it's current state DagBox comes with three kinds of services: data storage, logic, and locking.</p>
<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>The data storage workers provide a key-value storage. They use <a href="https://symas.com/lightning-memory-mapped-database/">LMDB</a> to store the data. We have chosen LMDB as it provides us very high resistance to corruption and doesn't require any special recovery procedures after crashes.</p>
<p>The data store is split into buckets, each stored in a separate LMDB databases in a single storage environment. These buckets allow clients to group data based on their needs. All data storage workers have access to all buckets.</p>
<p>We have two kinds of data store workers: data readers and data writers. This distinction is useful because LMDB is able to work without any locking when there is only 1 writer and multiple readers.</p>
<p>Data read requests are serialized with MessagePack. In JSON form, they would look like:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    &#39;bucket&#39;: &#39;user&#39;,</div><div class="line">    &#39;key&#39;: &#39;f3eb6d44-eedf-484f-af0c-fe9ee79c4e89&#39;,</div><div class="line">    &#39;relations&#39;: {</div><div class="line">        &quot;comments&quot;: [</div><div class="line">            {</div><div class="line">                &#39;bucket&#39;: &#39;comment&#39;,</div><div class="line">                &#39;key&#39;: &#39;12bf8e82-837a-43a0-abf9-3324e6ae1465&#39;</div><div class="line">            }</div><div class="line">        ]</div><div class="line">    }</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>This structure may repeat recursively by using the "relations" key in the objects. This allows very complex requests to be constructed. The worker will reply with a similar message, with "data" keys in each object that contain the data for the corresponding key.</p>
<p>Similarly, write requests are also serialized with MessagePack. In JSON form:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">{</div><div class="line">    &#39;bucket&#39;: &#39;user&#39;,</div><div class="line">    &#39;data&#39;: &#39;...........&#39;</div><div class="line">}</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>The worker will respond with the key that was created to store the data.</p>
<h2>Logic</h2>
<p>The logic workers are designed to maintain a rule and fact database, and perform queries on them. Logic workers are only made aware of the keys of data, the actual data is only stored in data storage workers. In DagBox it is possible for workers to cooperate on a single request, this capability is used by the logic workers to perform the query and then pass the request to data storage workers to retrieve the actual data.</p>
<p>The implementation of logic workers is not yet complete.</p>
<h2>Locking</h2>
<p>Locking worker provides allows clients to lock or unlock keys. This can be used by the clients to avoid race conditions in their applications by first locking the keys they will modify.</p>
<h2>Message Broker</h2>
<div class="image">
<object type="image/svg+xml" data="broker.svg">broker.svg</object>
<div class="caption">
An example state for the broker.</div></div>
<p> The message broker keeps queues for every service. When under load, the requests are queued up to be assigned to workers as they become free. The broker also keeps track of all registered workers, ensuring that they haven't crashed before assigning work to them. </p>
